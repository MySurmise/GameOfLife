# Game Of Life

You can run this little program in your command line interface or other terminal.

Make sure to comment in/out the correct characters because e.g. in CMD only * and spaces will work.

In my VS Code Output console, ⬜ and ⬛ also work, which makes for a much better "playing field".

This is my first little project and I made it so I can experiment with GitHub.

## Subheader

I also made this Subheader to see how it looks like.

Looking good. Will use it in the future. lol.

### Does this work too?

Markdown is hands down the coolest thing ever. lol.
