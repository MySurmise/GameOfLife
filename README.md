# Game Of Life

You can run this little program in your command line interface or other terminal.

Make sure to comment in/out the correct characters because e.g. in CMD only stars and spaces will work.
Also be sure to have the right font selected, so nothing gets shifted.

In my VS Code Output console, ⬜ and ⬛ also work, which makes for a much better "playing field".

This is my first little project and I made it so I can experiment with GitHub.

## Subheader

I also made this Subheader to see how it looks like.

Looking good. Will use it in the future. lol.

### Does this work too?

Markdown is hands down the coolest thing ever. lol.
